            <p> Born in Italy on June 3rd, 1994, Edoardo Cino discovered his passion for dance and music at the age of 10. <br>
		At 18, Edoardo joined the pre-prfessional dance program "Eko Dance Project” (Turin, IT), delving deep into<br> 
		the captivating artistic realm envisioned by Pompea Santoro where he mastered ballet technique and opened up<br> 
		to modern and contemporary dancing. In 2013, he made his first professional experiences with <br>
		"The very secret dance society" (Turin, IT), directed by Raffaele Irace.<br>
		<br>
		Edoardo has been a soloist dancer at the "Saarländisches Staatstheater" (Saarbrücken, DE) since 2015, under<br>
		the direction of the versatile choreographer Stijn Celis. His performances in Saarbrücken have showcased his<br> 
		skill, featuring prominently in numerous creations by Stijn Celis and interpreting the works of renowned choreographers.<br>
		<br>
		Venturing into choreography, Edoardo debuted his creative spirit in 2017 by participating in the<br> 
		Saarländisches Staatstheater prduction for emerging choreographers. In 2023 he successfully presented in Mannheim<br> 
		"Ephemeral Dialogue 468", a short piece created in collaboration with dance artist Micaela Romano, and later<br> 
		he joined Theaterhaus Jena to make the satirical dance-theater evening "Die Hundekot-Attacke".<br>
