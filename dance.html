	    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
                <p>
		At the age of 18, Edoardo moves the first steps as professional dancer in the freelance scene of Torino (IT). The meeting with the choreographer<br> 
		Rffaele Irace and his group "the very secret dance society" was surely one of the most important for his professional beginning. In 2015, with the help<br> 
		of his teacher and mentor Pompea Santoro, Edoardo joins the Saarländisches Staatstheater of Saarbrücken (DE), directed by the choreographer Stijn Celis.<br> 
		Here he has lots of opportunity to work with many renown choreographers and to mature his artistry. In 2018 he is the leading role in "Amore", a dance<br> 
		piece created by Stin Celis and inspired by the novel "L'amour" of Marguerite Duras. The year after he plays again a leading role in "Verweile doch" by Kim<br>
		Brandstrup and in "Shunkin" by Celis. With the latter Edoardo establishes a fruitful artistic connection that will lead to many other successful productions<br> 
		like "Prometheus", "Sound & Vision", "Winterreise" and "The privacy of things". The artisrtic research conducted with Anna Konjetzky and Moritz Ostruschjak will<br> 
		also have a strong impact on his dancing. As for the repertoire, Edoardo has the privilege to perform in many famous dance pieces like "Forgotten Land" and<br> 
		"Bella Figura" by Jiri Kylián, "Cacti" by Alexander Ekman, "Selon Desir" By Andonis Foniadakis, "La Stravaganza" by Anjelin Preljočaj, "Liedgut" by Richard Siegal,<br> 
		"Whiteout" by Marco Göcke and he has the wonderful opportunity to dance a leading role in "Der grüne Tisch" by Kurt Jooss.

            <h2>Dance studies</h2>
                <p>
		Edoardo beginn with dancing at the age of 10 in his hometown Avellino (IT). Here he joins the vocational school "Arte in Movimento", directed by Antonella De Angelis<br> 
		and starts learning about ballet and Horton technique. In 2008 he moves in Torino (IT) with his family and focuses his dance studies on ballet with the school of<br> 
		"Teatro Nuovo Torino", directed by Daniela Chianini and with private classes on Vaganova technique with the russian teacher Oxana Kichenko. The hard work of this years<br> 
		is praised in 2011 with the third place in the senior soloist category at the national dance competiton "Festival Ballet" in Massa Carrara (IT), and the year after with<br> 
		the first place in the same category at the national dance competition "Je Danse" in Cumiana (IT). In those years he is invited to join the new and experimental<br> 
		pre-professional dance program "Eko Dance Project" led by the incredible dance artist Pompea Santoro. Her teaching brings Edoardo's dancing on new heights and new fields<br>
		and the design of the project gives him a lot of stage experience all across the country. In 2014 he gets the honor to represent his country at the Italian-Egyptian<br> 
		festival in Cairo City by performing the dance solo "Pas de Danse" by Mats Ek. The learning process never stopps for Edoardo and in fact he often participates in<br> 
		workshops and summer intesives in which he explores other views on dance.
